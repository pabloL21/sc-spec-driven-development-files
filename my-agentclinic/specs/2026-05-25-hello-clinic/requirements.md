# Phase 1 Requirements: Hello Clinic

## Scope

Phase 1 creates the smallest running AgentClinic web app. The feature introduces a local Hono server and a single home page that proves the app can render server-side HTML in a browser.

## User-Facing Requirements

- Users can open the app locally in a modern browser.
- The home page displays the product name, `AgentClinic`.
- The home page includes a short welcome message for the clinic demo.
- The page is intentionally simple and does not include dashboard navigation yet.

## Technical Requirements

- Use TypeScript on Node.js.
- Use Hono as the web framework.
- Render plain server-side HTML.
- Compose the home page from separate header, main, and footer component modules.
- Use a layout module for the full HTML document shell, including metadata and the stylesheet link.
- Link a standalone CSS file from the HTML and serve it from the app.
- Avoid adding a frontend framework, database, authentication, or client-side build pipeline.
- Keep files and folders minimal; do not create future structure before it is needed.

## Decisions

- This phase is limited to a tiny Hono home page.
- The route handler should stay small by delegating document structure to the layout module.
- Browser verification is manual.
- Command-line validation should include a lightweight `curl` check against the local server.
- Styling can be minimal, but Phase 1 includes the basic layout CSS needed by the header, main, and footer.

## Context

AgentClinic is a course/demo app for learning spec-driven development with an AI coding agent. The first phase should make the project feel real without expanding the domain model yet. Later phases will add layout, agents, ailments, therapies, appointments, and persistence.

## Out of Scope

- Agents, ailments, therapies, appointments, and navigation.
- SQLite or durable storage.
- Automated browser testing.
- Production deployment.
- Advanced styling or dashboard polish.
